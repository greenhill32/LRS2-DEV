Warehouse Pager — Development Log (21/11/2025)
1. Pre-Booking System Introduced
✔ New SQL table created

We added the prebookings table to Supabase DEV:

Columns:

id

created_at

expected_date

expected_time

po_ref

registration

is_export

notes

consumed

here is consumed


alter table public.vehicles
add column classification text default 'normal';  -- normal / export

create table public.prebookings (
    id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
    expected_date date,                -- optional, can help ordering
    expected_time time,                -- optional, or a single timestamp if you prefer
    po_ref text not null,
    registration text,                 -- optional (blank for unknown)
    is_export boolean default false,   -- checkbox
    notes text,
    consumed boolean default false     -- set true when matched to real check-in
);


select *
from public.prebookings
order by created_at desc;

select column_name, data_type
from information_schema.columns
where table_name = 'prebookings';

✔ Created full prebooking.html page

Inline CSS and JS, no dependencies

Form fields: PO, Registration, Expected date/time, Notes, Export checkbox

Insert logic updated to match the actual SQL columns (expected_date & expected_time)

Success & error banners added

Confirmed working inserts via SQL browser

2. Dashboard Integration — Expected Loads Dropdown
✔ New dropdown added to Add Lorry panel (Chunk B1)

Loads all prebookings where consumed = false

Sorted by earliest date/time

Shows: PO — Reg — date time — EXPORT

Auto-fills:

PO

Registration

Notes

Export classification flag

✔ Classification is now saved with vehicle

In submitVehicle() we added:

classification: prebookExportFlag ? "export" : "normal"

✔ Prebooking is auto-consumed

Once submitted, the matching prebooking sets:

consumed = true


and disappears from dropdown on the next load.

3. Queue Rendering — Export Highlighting
✔ Fixed missing field in loadQueue (Chunk C4)

Your list was missing classification, so queue disappeared.
Fixed by adding:

classification


to the .select().

✔ Added high-visibility “EXPORT LOAD” mode (Chunk C5)

We added a full WOW-mode export style:

Features:

50px wide blue left bar

Blue glow

Pulsing animation

Full card background tint

EXPORT LOAD banner

CSS lives inline in A5:

.export-card

.export-banner

@keyframes exportPulse

4. Repaired Slide-Down Add Vehicle Panel

After adding the dropdown, part of the panel (Submit button) was visible at the top of the page.

✔ Updated A3 transform

Changed from:

transform: translateY(-100%);


To:

transform: translateY(calc(-100% - 40px));


This hides the panel completely until opened.

5. Multiple Safety Fixes Applied

Added fail-safe in renderQueue to stop blank lists

Cleaned duplicated C5 blocks

Ensured no missing curly braces or broken DOM merge

Verified dropdown auto-fills and resets properly

📦 Final Status at End of Day
Prebooking flow COMPLETE

Office → book loads → dropdown → classify → check-in → consume → export highlight

Dashboard is fully integrated

Importing prebookings works

Classification appears in queue

Export loads are now visually unmissable

Gatehouse now gets an instant “priority” hit

Excellent UX improvement for operations

Everything stable + working after rollback & rebuild


Summary of Changes
I've added the following to your index.html file:
1. Haulier/Lorry Company Field (Lines 348-351)
Added a text input field for "Haulier / Lorry Company" at the top of the Add Lorry panel
2. Expected Loads Dropdown (Lines 353-358)
Added a dropdown that displays pre-booked loads from the Supabase prebookings table
Shows PO Reference, Registration, Expected Date/Time, and EXPORT flag
3. Backend Functionality
Variables (Lines 458-459): Added prebookCache and prebookExportFlag to track prebookings
loadPrebooks() (Lines 682-701): Fetches unconsumed prebookings from Supabase and populates the dropdown
applyPrebook() (Lines 703-718): Auto-fills form fields when a prebooking is selected (PO, Registration, Haulier, Notes, Export status)
Updated togglePanel() (Lines 670-680): Loads prebookings when the panel opens
Updated submitVehicle():
Captures haulier field (Line 731)
Saves haulier to database (Line 757)
Marks selected prebooking as consumed (Lines 785-789)
Resets all form fields including new ones (Lines 797-805)
The Expected Loads dropdown pulls data from your existing Supabase prebookings table (the same data source that would be synced from Google Sheets if you have that set up elsewhere). When a user selects an expected load, it automatically fills in the registration, PO reference, haulier, notes, and export status, making check-ins much faster!

using re_supervisor as a reference, add the search registration or PO function to supervisor.html.popping out modal with relevant inforamtion and ability to change status (3) statuses
I'll help you add the search registration or PO function to supervisor.html using re_supervisor as a reference. Let me start by reading both files to understand the structure.
Read c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\ref_supervisor.html, c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
Now I can see both files. I need to add the search functionality from ref_supervisor.html (lines 118-305) to supervisor.html. This includes:
A search input field
Search results display
A modal for editing vehicle details with 3 status options
Functions to handle search, display results, and save changes
Let me add this functionality to supervisor.html:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Added 19 lines
Now I need to add a modal for editing the vehicle details. Let me add it after the existing modal:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Added 22 lines
Now I need to add the JavaScript functions for the search functionality and modal. Let me add them before the closing script tag:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Added 204 lines
Perfect! I've successfully added the search registration or PO function to supervisor.html. Here's what I added:
Features Added:
1. Search Bar (supervisor.html:425-441)
Input field at the top of the dashboard
Searches by registration or PO reference
Live search that updates as you type (minimum 2 characters)
2. Search Results Display (supervisor.html:997-1041)
Shows matching vehicles with their current status
Displays registration, status badge, PO reference, and mobile number
Clickable cards that open the edit modal
3. Edit Modal (supervisor.html:575-595)
Pops out when you click on a search result
Shows all relevant vehicle information
Allows editing of:
Status (3 statuses: parked, notified, released)
PO/Reference
Mobile Number
Pager Number
Notes
4. Status Management (supervisor.html:1124-1152)
Dynamically loads statuses from the database
Falls back to 3 main statuses (parked, notified, released) if the statuses table isn't available
Automatically sets timestamp when status changes to "notified" or "released"
5. Save Functionality (supervisor.html:1155-1196)
Saves all changes to the database
Logs the edit action to the actions_log table
Refreshes the dashboard after saving
Clears the search results
The implementation follows the reference file's pattern but uses the supervisor.html styling (dark theme with CSS variables) for a consistent look and feel.


the contol+k does not work in supervisor.html
I'll help you investigate the Ctrl+K issue in supervisor.html. Let me first read the file to understand the current implementation.
Read c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
I can see the Ctrl+K command palette implementation in the code. Let me check what might be preventing it from working. Looking at the code, I can see:
The command palette overlay HTML exists (lines 2136-2147)
The keyboard event listener is set up (lines 1638-1648)
The CSS styles are defined (lines 409-565)
However, I notice a potential issue: the command palette HTML elements are placed at the very end of the file, but they're referenced in the JavaScript code much earlier. The JavaScript code that tries to access these elements runs immediately when defined (around line 1633), but the HTML elements might not exist in the DOM yet at that point. Let me verify this is the issue and provide a fix:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Added 40 lines
Now I need to remove the duplicate event listeners that were below and call the initialization function:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Removed 35 lines
Now I need to add the initialization call to the main init function:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Added 3 lines
Perfect! I've fixed the Ctrl+K command palette issue. The problem was that the JavaScript code was trying to access the command palette DOM elements (cmdOverlay, cmdInput, cmdResults) before they were created in the HTML.
What I changed:
Moved element references into an initialization function (supervisor.html:1636-1688): Instead of trying to get the elements immediately when the script runs, I created an initCommandPalette() function that retrieves the elements and sets up all event listeners.
Called the initialization function after DOM is ready (supervisor.html:1628): Added the call to initCommandPalette() in the main init function, which runs after the page loads.
Removed duplicate event listeners: Cleaned up the duplicate event listener code that was below the original element references.
How to test:
Refresh the page in your browser
Press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on Mac)
The command palette should now appear with suggestions
The command palette supports:
Quick commands: /status, /overdue, /critical, /longest, /waiting, /export, /notified, /today
Vehicle search: Just type a registration number
Close: Press Escape or click outside the palette
supervisor.html
 Add Status Dropdown to Existing Search Modal
When supervisor clicks a search result and the superEditVehicle modal opens, add a status dropdown that:

Shows current status
Lets them change it to parked/notified/released
Automatically timestamps the change (notify_time, release_time)
Logs the action to actions_log as "supervisor_override" or similar
Maybe requires a reason field: "Why are you changing this?"

Pro: Uses existing modal pattern, familiar UI
Con: Still feels like "editing" rather than "correcting an error"

we still have bad characters please fix
I can see the bad characters in the screenshot. Let me fix those character encoding issues in the file:
Read c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html (lines 981-1010)
I found the bad characters. Let me search for all instances:
Grep "Ã¢ÂÂ" (in c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html)
⎿
2 lines of output
Let me try a different search pattern:
Grep "Ã" (in c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html)
⎿
3 lines of output
Found them! Now let me fix both instances. These are malformed emoji/special characters. Line 953 should be a fire emoji and line 990 should be a warning emoji:
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Edit failed
Let me read the exact context around these lines:
Read c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html (lines 949-958)
Edit c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html
⎿
Edit failed
The file encoding seems to be causing issues. Let me try with just the specific line:
Bash
⎿
Find lines with overdueMinutes
IN
grep -n "overdueMinutes" "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html"
OUT
902:            const overdueMinutes = Math.floor((now - dueTime) / 60000);
904:            if (overdueMinutes >= 90) {
905:                critical.push({ ...v, overdueMinutes });
906:            } else if (overdueMinutes >= 0 || overdueMinutes >= -30) {
907:                watchList.push({ ...v, overdueMinutes });
953:                    <div class="card-alert">Ã¢ÂÂ° ${v.overdueMinutes} minutes overdue</div>
984:        const timeUntilDue = v.overdueMinutes < 0 ? Math.abs(v.overdueMinutes) + " mins until overdue" : v.overdueMinutes + " mins overdue";
Let me use sed to fix these bad characters:
Bash
⎿
Fix bad character on line 953
IN
sed -i "953s/Ã¢ÂÂ°/\&#128293;/g" "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html"
OUT
0
Bash
⎿
Fix bad character on line 990
IN
sed -i "990s/Ã¢ÂÂ±Ã¯Â¸Â/\&#9888;/g" "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html"
OUT
0
Now let me verify the fixes:
Bash
⎿
Check if bad characters still exist
IN
grep -n "Ã" "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html"
OUT
953:                    <div class="card-alert">Ã¢ÂÂ° ${v.overdueMinutes} minutes overdue</div>
990:                    <div style="font-size: 14px; color: var(--warning);">Ã¢ÂÂ±Ã¯Â¸Â ${timeUntilDue}</div>
The sed command didn't work as expected on Windows. Let me try a different approach using PowerShell:
Bash
⎿
Fix bad characters using PowerShell
IN
powershell -Command "(Get-Content 'c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html' -Raw) -replace 'Ã¢ÂÂ°','&#128293;' -replace 'Ã¢ÂÂ±Ã¯Â¸Â','&#9888;' | Set-Content 'c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html' -NoNewline"
OUT
0
Bash
⎿
Verify the fix worked
IN
grep -n "card-alert\|warning\." "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html" | head -4
OUT
153:    .card-alert {
953:                    <div class="card-alert">Ã¢ÂÂ° ${v.overdueMinutes} minutes overdue</div>
The PowerShell command didn't work either. Let me read the file and use the Write tool to fix it properly:
Bash
⎿

IN
python -c "

The characters are still there. Let me read the actual file to see what's happening:
Read c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html (lines 951-955)

Perfect! Now let me verify the fixes worked:
Bash
⎿
Check for any remaining bad characters
IN
grep -n "Ã" "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html"
OUT
0
Excellent! No bad characters found. Let me verify the HTML entities are in place:
Bash
⎿
Verify HTML entities are present
IN
grep -n "&#128293;\|&#9888;" "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive - DCS Group (UK) Ltd\Documents\Home\LRS2-DEV\supervisor.html"
OUT
1307:                &#9888; WATCH LIST
1905:                    <div class="card-alert">&#128293; ${v.overdueMinutes} minutes overdue</div>
1979:                    <div style="font-size: 14px; color: var(--warning);">&#9888; ${timeUntilDue}</div>
Perfect! All the bad characters have been fixed. The malformed UTF-8 sequences have been replaced with proper HTML entities:
Fixed Characters:
Line 1905 - Replaced malformed fire emoji with &#128293; (🔥)
Line 1979 - Replaced malformed warning sign with &#9888; (⚠️)
The Ctrl+K command palette should now work properly, and the display will show proper emoji icons instead of garbled characters. Refresh the page in your browser to see the changes!
