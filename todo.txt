which ever page you are on it will alsway be greyed out over arrivals.

the page shows arrivals | queue | supervisor. the other pages do load but it only looks like it in arrivals grey shading.

on arrivals page it feeds from json unitl an api is used.
 the whole days schedule should stay on the page. as we work thorugh the day we will get completions. these will still be visible in arrivals page NOT index page.

so it should be lorry arrives (expected) gatehouse checks them in a qr code and sms simulation pop up.
they get sent to lorry park (parked status)
they get notified to move to loading area (notifed status)
when complete they get markerd complete.

the lorry should show in the arrivals page all day (cleansed before the following day)
lorry should disappear from index (queue) once complete
