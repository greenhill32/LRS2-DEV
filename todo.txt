on arrivals page it feeds from json unitl an api is used.
 the whole days schedule should stay on the page. as we work thorugh the day we will get completions. these will still be visible in arrivals page NOT index page.

so it should be lorry arrives (expected) gatehouse checks them in a qr code and sms simulation pop up.
they get sent to lorry park (parked status)
they get notified to move to loading area (notifed status)
when complete they get markerd complete.

the lorry should show in the arrivals page all day (cleansed before the following day)
lorry should disappear from index (queue) once complete.

in arrivals there is no login/out feature.someone must be logged in for audit who added lorry?

in add lorry modal index.html there is no way to exit

if add lorry manually from Index.html the sms triggers but if added from arrivals screen  (into add lorry modal) it does not trigger

need to add manula pallet adjustment in arrivals.

in arrivals remove customer it is not given.
there are expected start / end times

adjust to accomaodate this
